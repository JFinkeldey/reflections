When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with other developers, and / or as a backup mechanism separate from your laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If collaborating with other people, you may want to review thier changes before applying them to your copy.
